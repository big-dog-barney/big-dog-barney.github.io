<p>i'm a two year old german shepherd & belgian malinois mix. i love other doggies, LOVE going on long walks and runs, and am the biggest cuddler you could find. i'm super food motivated, so teaching me tricks is not too hard - and i'm pretty smart, even if i do say so myself. so far, i can sit, always come when called, lie down on command, shake, roll over, and am potty trained. i do at least one training session with my trainer every week and they say that i’m really easy to train and very intelligent.

i’ve had a bit of a rough past - i spent the first two years of my life in a kill shelter in california where i was not treated the nicest. despite this, i’m still very energetic, curious, loving, and trusting (sometimes i’m a little shy when i first meet a new friend, but i always warm up).
</p>

i love playing fetch, and i have a new found love of any and all toys. my favorites are squeaky stuffed animals, like the pink bunny kong i'm holding onto in one of the pictures below. i might grab a slipper or two if you leave it lying around, but don't worry, i'm very gentle with them and would never rip them up!

i'm on the hunt for my forever home, and promise to be the best friend you've ever had. that said, it's important you understand that i'm definitely a lot of work. i shed a lot, and require a lot of exercise and mental stimulation (but i will still love to take naps with you). i like meeting new people, but i'm a little wary at first because of my history, so make sure you're patient with me at first. i would love to come home with you, but please make sure you've done your research on my breed first, because we can be a lot for first time dog owners.

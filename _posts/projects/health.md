<p>
i’m a very healthy two year old pup. i’ve had all my vaccines and am neutered, so taking me to a dog park or doggy day care wont be a problem. i did have ticks when my foster parents got me since they’re pretty common in california, but i’ve had multiple tick treatments and they’ve been gone for months. i’ve never had any serious health issues, as far as my foster parents know. my foster parents think i'm microchipped, but they can help you look into that more once you’ve officially adopted me and you can update my registration, and my foster parents will help transfer over all our health paper work. let us know if you have any questions!</p>
